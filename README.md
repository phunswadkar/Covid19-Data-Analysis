# Covid19-Data-Analysis | Covid 19 Data analysis using Python


## Overview
The project goal is to analyze the relationship between the spread of the COVID-19 virus and happiness levels in different countries. 
We will use two datasets: the COVID-19 dataset published by John Hopkins University and a dataset of various life factors scored by people living in each country around the globe. 

To achieve this we will merge these two datasets and analyze them to see if there is any correlation between the spread of the virus and happiness levels. Our primary objective was to understand how the COVID-19 pandemic is affecting people's happiness levels. 
This information could be used to develop policies and programs to help people cope with the pandemic and to improve their happiness levels.

## The Approach
### Task 1: Introduction

Understand the purpose of the project

### Task 2: Importing COVID19 dataset 

Import COVID19 dataset and prepare it for the analysis by dropping columns and aggregating rows.

### Task 3: Finding a good Measure 

Decide on and calculate a good measure for our analysis.

### Task 4: Importing World happiness report dataset 

Import World happiness report dataset, dropping useless columns and Merge it with COVID19 dataset to find correlations among our data.

### Task 5: Visualizing the results 

Visualize our results using Seaborn.

## Result
We have found positive correlation among the columns related to Happiness of People living in the country and the spread of corona virus in that country. Developed countries are more prone to getting the infection and are more likely be impacted in terms of Happiness Levels and thus more policies and programs are required to be implemented to help people cope with pandemic and to improve their happiness levels.
